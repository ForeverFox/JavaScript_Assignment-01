Coffee Coupon

You’ve been hired by a coffee shop to create an online coupon. They already have a coupon they’ve been emailing to their customers, but they now want to host it on their website. Since it’s going to live online, they are going to want search engines to find the text about their enticing promotion. This means you’ll have to re-build the image using HTML and CSS.

Use an image editor, such as Adobe Photoshop, to cut the image into pieces that you will reference in your HTML. If there are any areas of solid color, feel free to use the CSS background-color property to style that area. Remember, all the text has to be readable by search engines, so it must be in HTML.

The client also wants to give their users a little extra push towards using the coupon. After 5 seconds on the page, they want an alert window to pop up saying "Print now!". The client has also specified that the coupon look correct in both IE8 and Firefox 4.
